This program is written in C++ and uses the Windows Core Audio API to enumerate all active audio input devices on a Windows system. It prints the friendly name of each device and prompts the user to select one of the devices by entering its number.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what the program does:

The CoInitializeEx function is called to initialize the COM library for use by the calling thread.
An instance of the IMMDeviceEnumerator interface is created using the CoCreateInstance function.
The EnumAudioEndpoints method of the IMMDeviceEnumerator interface is called to enumerate all active audio input devices (i.e., devices with the eCapture data flow and the DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE state).
The GetCount method of the IMMDeviceCollection interface is called to get the number of devices in the collection.
If there are no devices in the collection, a message is printed to indicate that no audio input devices were found.
Otherwise, a loop is used to iterate over each device in the collection.
For each device, the Item method of the IMMDeviceCollection interface is called to get a pointer to the device.
The OpenPropertyStore method of the IMMDevice interface is called to open the property store of the device.
The GetValue method of the IPropertyStore interface is called to get the value of the PKEY_Device_FriendlyName property, which contains the friendly name of the device.
The friendly name of the device is printed to the standard output stream.
After all devices have been processed, the user is prompted to enter the number of the device they want to select.
